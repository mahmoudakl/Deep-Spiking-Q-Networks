# Breakout Experiments
The jupyter notebooks Patel-Small-Fully-Connected.ipynb and Patel-Small-Fully-Connected-Load-and-Conversion.ipynb show how to
train, load, and convert a DQN and a DSQN on Breakout according to Patel et al. Compare thesis section 4.3.3 and table B.3.
The notebook Mnih-Large-Convolutional.ipynb discusses our preliminary code on training a competitive DQN on Breakout. This code 
still needs some improvements which are discussed in the notebook and is provided in the form of python scripts in the files
TrainMnihBinary.py, LoadMnihBinary.py, and ConversionMnihBinary.py.
