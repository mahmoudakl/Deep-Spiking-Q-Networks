# Breakout Experiments
The notebooks Patel-Small-Fully-Connected.ipynb and Patel-Small-Fully-Connected-Load-and-Conversion.ipynb demonstrate how to 
train, load, and convert a small fully connected network on Breakout. Compare thesis, section 4.3.3 and table B.3.
The notebook Mnih-Large-Convolutional.ipynb discusses preliminary code provided in the files TrainMnihBinary.py,
LoadMnihBinary.py, and ConversionMnihBinary.py which trains a competitive DQN.
