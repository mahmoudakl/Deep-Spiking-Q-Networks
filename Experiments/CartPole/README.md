# CartPole Experiments / Tutorials
The experiments in this folder serve as a tutorial on how to use our code and are intended to be viewed in the following order:
  1. DQN-Training (How to train a conventional DQN and a spiking DQN using Surrogate Gradients (DSQN).)
  2. Load-DQN (How to load a previously saved D(S)QN and how to save a replay dataset.)
  3. Train-Classifier (How to train a spiking or non-spiking classifier on the saved replay data set.)
  4. SNN-Conversion (How to convert a DQN and a Classifier to a SNN.)
  5. Load in NEST (How to load a converted or directly trained spiking network in NEST.)
  6. Conversion in pyNN with NEST or SpyNNaker (How to load spiking network in pyNN using NEST or SpyNNaker as backend.)
